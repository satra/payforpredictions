Red Cross Red Crescent workers must balance their time and resources between long-term programming such as hygiene promotion, preparing right before a disaster happens, and responding to disasters when they happen. Fortunately, there are many tools to help with this, including science-based forecasts that can help people anticipate a disaster. While forecasts can be confusing, making a strategy for how to act based on a forecast can help humanitarian workers best manage their time and resources.\n",
